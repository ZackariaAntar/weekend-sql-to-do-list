/* // Styling
// Use CSS styling to move the aesthetic of the page beyond the vanilla HTML look:

// background color of the page
// font family and size
// text color & or background color of tasks to show whether or not they have been completed
// Approach
// We would recommend you spend some time thinking about how to approach this problem.
// Think through all the logic that will be needed prior to writing any code. */
