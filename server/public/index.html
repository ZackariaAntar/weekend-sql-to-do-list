<!-- // Create a front end experience that allows a user to create a Task.
// When the Task is created, it should be stored inside of a database (SQL)
// Whenever a Task is created the front end should refresh to show all tasks that need to be completed.
// Each Task should have an option to 'Complete' or 'Delete'.
// When a Task is complete, its visual representation should change on the front end.
//      For example, the background of the task container could change from gray to green.
//      The complete option should be 'checked off'. Each of these are accomplished in CSS, but will need to hook into logic to know whether or not the task is complete. -->
